// CLIENT tool — no runtime `execute`, the SDK loop suspends after the call
// until the UI resolves it via addToolResult (approve / reject). Registered
// with `dynamicTool` (not `tool`) on purpose: the AI SDK silently drops
// invalid input for static client tools, but surfaces a `tool-error` to the
// model for dynamic ones (parseToolCall in ai/dist/index.mjs:4521). Validation
// lives in `draftTransactionBatchSchema.superRefine` (same `validateDraftBatch`
// used by replaceBuffer at the journal-write boundary) — on bad input the
// model gets per-entry issues back and re-emits in the same turn, without an
// empty approval card cluttering history.
//
// `dynamicTool`'s TypeScript signature requires `execute`, but the runtime
// (executeToolCall: `if (tool?.execute == null) return void 0`) short-circuits
// on a literally-undefined execute. We provide `undefined` cast to the
// expected type to keep the suspending behavior while satisfying the compiler.
